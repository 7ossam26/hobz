## Phase 0 — Foundation & Architecture

**Date:** 2026-08-13 · **Model:** Opus 5

### Built

- Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript strict (plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `noImplicitOverride`, `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`),
  pnpm, ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier.
- Tailwind v4 (CSS-first `@theme`), class-driven dark mode, zinc surface scale +
  one violet accent, density CSS variable, `tabular-nums` utility.
- IBM Plex Sans Arabic served from `public/fonts/` — Arabic and Latin subsets,
  four weights, `unicode-range` split, preloaded. No CDN at build or runtime.
- shadcn/ui initialised (`components.json`, `new-york`, zinc) with `Button`.
- Prisma + Postgres 16. Seven models only: `User`, `Role`, `Permission`,
  `RolePermission`, `UserRole`, `AuditLog`, `Setting`. Migration committed.
- `docker-compose.yml` (app + postgres + `agency_test`), multi-stage
  Dockerfile with standalone output and a healthcheck.
- `lib/`: `db`, `money`, `settings`, `rbac`, `audit`, `calendar`, `scheduler`,
  `auth/session`, `errors`, `utils`.
- `src/i18n/ar.ts` — the full Arabic string table.
- `src/modules/setting/` — the reference module (actions/service/queries/schema/types).
- Vitest (unit + integration projects) and Playwright per `docs/TESTING.md`,
  including `tests/setup/db-guard.ts`, factories, fixtures and helpers.
- Seed: permission catalog, `SUPER_ADMIN`, default settings.
- **150 unit tests, 99.4% coverage** on delivered code.

### Decisions worth recording

**Money rounds HALF_UP, not banker's.** Statistically defensible is not the bar;
a manager explaining a deduction to a worker is. `round2` is called once, at the
end of a chain — `lib/money` keeps 34 digits of intermediate precision. There is
a test asserting the two orders differ (70.00 vs 69.99 on a three-day penalty),
because that piaster is the whole argument.

**`format()` strips bidi control marks.** ICU injects LRM/RLM around currency and
negatives, and their placement varies between ICU versions, which would make the
function untestable. Direction is handled at the render layer instead
(`dir="ltr"` + `tabular-nums`), which is more robust than embedded marks.

**Settings: missing → default, invalid → throw.** A missing row is normal (before
the seed, after adding a catalog entry). A row that fails its schema is
corruption, and silently falling back to a default there is exactly how a wrong
deduction gets produced and defended. Loud is correct.

**Every Phase 0 stub throws.** `lib/calendar`, `lib/auth/session`,
`rbac.scopeProjects/scopeTasks` raise `NotImplementedError` naming the phase that
owns them. A `workingDaysBetween` returning `0` would make the penalty engine
compute zero deductions and _look_ like it worked. A `scopeProjects` returning
`{}` would grant every user every project the moment someone wired it up.

**The advisory lock is transaction-level, not session-level.** Prisma pools
connections, so `pg_advisory_lock` could be taken on one connection and released
on another. `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` inside an interactive transaction is
pinned to that transaction and released on commit, rollback _or process death_ —
which is the case that matters during a redeploy.

**Manual and scheduled runs share one code path.** `runJob()` is used by both, so
a manager clicking "recalculate" during the 03:00 job contends for the same lock
instead of producing a second penalty.

**Invariants encoded as lint rules, not review comments.** Arabic literals
outside `src/i18n`, physical CSS directions, and `next/*`/`react` imports inside
`lib/` or `service.ts` all fail the build. Each rule was verified to actually
fire against a deliberate violation — a rule that silently matches nothing is
worse than no rule.

**Seed does not force a password change.** Per the brief. The operator picked the
password; forcing a change would be theatre. The seed also never overwrites an
existing `Setting`, so re-running it post-go-live cannot reset a grace period.

**`AuditLog` has no `updatedAt` and no `deletedAt`.** Their absence is the
schema-level statement of the append-only invariant.

### Surprises

**The shadcn button cost 77 kB of client JS.** The current registry generates
`import { Slot } from "radix-ui"` — the umbrella package. One button on an
otherwise empty page took the route from 103 kB to **180 kB First Load JS**,
precisely the SPEC §9 budget, before a single feature existed. Switching to the
scoped `@radix-ui/react-slot` returned it to 103 kB. A lint rule now bans the
umbrella import, because `shadcn add` will keep generating it.

Baseline after the fix: `/` = **127 B route, 103 kB First Load JS**.

**Prisma's `Decimal` is `decimal.js`.** `lib/money` depends on `decimal.js`
directly rather than on `Prisma.Decimal`, which keeps money arithmetic testable
without a generated client while staying wire-compatible with Prisma.

**The test harness needed `TEST_DATABASE_URL` promotion.** `.env` defines both
URLs, but Prisma only ever reads `DATABASE_URL` — so `pnpm test:integration`
would have migrated and truncated the developer's _dev_ database while the
`_test` guard sat there approving it. `db-guard.ts` now promotes
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` over `DATABASE_URL` before asserting, so the suffix check
applies to the promoted value and a mistyped test URL is still caught.

**Prettier reflows the contract documents.** `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/*.md` are
authored, not generated; formatting them repadded every Arabic table for no
benefit. They are in `.prettierignore`. Added `.gitattributes` with `eol=lf` as
well — this repo is developed on Windows and built in Linux containers, and
CRLF in `docker/postgres/init-test-db.sh` would make it unexecutable.

**Mapped-type assignment needed one cast.** In `settings/store.ts`, TypeScript
cannot see that a value produced for key `k` belongs in slot `k` of a mapped type
when `k` is only known at runtime. One localized, commented cast; the public
signature (`getSetting('penalty.defaultGraceHours')` → `number`) stays exact.

### Deferred (with owners)

| Deferred                                                                    | Phase |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `lib/calendar` implementation — working days, holidays, leave               | 6     |
| `lib/rbac` scope helpers (`view.all` vs `view.assigned` where-clauses)      | 1     |
| `lib/auth` — Auth.js v5 credentials, JWT, bcrypt, rate limiting             | 1     |
| `LedgerEntry` + the DB trigger rejecting `UPDATE`/`DELETE`                  | 7     |
| Integration test suite (no models with write paths yet beyond settings)     | 1     |
| The six Playwright journeys (Phase 0 ships the RTL/font smoke check only)   | 1–12  |
| The 10-hue semantic data palette                                            | 2     |
| Registering actual scheduler jobs (`src/instrumentation.ts` lists the four) | 6–9   |

### Known limitations

- **`pnpm test` runs no integration tests.** `passWithNoTests` is set at the root
  so an empty integration project does not fail the run. The coverage gate is
  what keeps the unit suite honest. Phase 1 lands the first integration tests.
- **Coverage `include` is scoped** to code Phase 0 implements. Widen it in
  `vitest.config.ts` as each module lands, or the global 70% gate becomes
  meaningless.
- **The integration harness has never been executed**, because no Postgres was
  reachable on the build machine. `db-guard`, `global-setup` and `reset` are
  unit-tested where they can be, but the truncate/migrate path itself is
  unproven until Phase 1 runs it against a real container.
- **`prisma/migrations/20260813000000_init` was produced with `migrate diff`**
  against the schema, not by `migrate dev` against a live database — no Postgres
  was available on the build machine. It should be applied to a clean database
  and verified before the first real deployment.
- **Docker images were not built or run here** (no Docker on the build machine).
  The Dockerfile and compose file are written but unverified end to end.
- **`package.json#prisma` seed config is deprecated** in Prisma 7. Migrate to
  `prisma.config.ts` when upgrading; it is only a warning on 6.x.
